## 🔍 Repository Overview

This repository currently includes:

📌 **Jupyter Notebooks** with fine-tuned LLM examples:  
- Fine-tuning LLaMA-3 models  
- Instruction-tuned assistants  
- Tiny/biomedical versions of large models  

Each notebook walks you through loading, tuning, and testing custom LLM workflows.

## 🧠 What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a large pre-trained language model to perform better on a specific task or dataset — such as instruction following, code generation, domain-specific text, or specialized Q&A. This typically builds on the general knowledge learned during the original pre-training and tailors it to your needs. Advanced techniques like **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g., LoRA / QLoRA)** can greatly reduce compute while maintaining performance.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
